According to the HTTP/1.1 Spec:

The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource
identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line

In other words, POST is used to create.


The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.
If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered
as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to
an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent,
the origin server can create the resource with that URI."

That is, PUT is used to create or update.
